BOTE - Back of the Envelope
_____

Often when designing systems its must to understand whats possible and where the bottlenecks could arise based on the architecture choices. A simple back of the envelope calculation would give you an approximate of whats acheivable.

While thats good, the current hardware you have might not actually reflect the latency you are expecting. So a quick and easy way to validate some of the characteristics of hardware is key earlier in the project.
